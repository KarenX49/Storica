        <p>Armenia is one of the most ancient countries in the world, existing since the time of Assyria, Egipt and
            Babylon. Theouhought millennia, winemaking hes stopped and started due to genocide and geopolitical
            conflict. Today, the wine industry is experiencing a wine renaissance.</p>

    <div class="text" id="text">
        <p>The armenian terroir is unique and similar to only a handful of other wine growing reginons. our terroir is
            defined by four main aspects: High elevation viticulture. Indigenous varities, volcanic soil, and an ancient

    <h1>Ancient History</h1>
    <div class="text text_marg">
        <p>Wine has been produced in the land where Armenia is currently located for over 6,000 years, confirmed by a
            team of researchers in 2007, from UCLA and the Armenian Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography, who
            discovered the oldest winemaking facility in the world, the Areni-1 cave, located in Areni, Vayots Dzor.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text" id="text_2">
        <p>From it’s ancient roots, through a transitional era of privatization due to the dissolution of the USSR, and
            during modern times, wine production and grape- growing has survived much like the Armenian people
            themselves, across centuries and millennia.</p>
